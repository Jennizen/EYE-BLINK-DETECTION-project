We represent a real time method based on some video and image processing algorithms for eye blink detection. 
The motivation of this research is the need of disabling who cannot communicate with human.

1.3	Main objectives

1.3.1	Allow paralysis victims to communicate independently
Be accessible to people with financial constraints
1.6	Scope

The Scope of the proposed work is on HUMAN COMPUTER INTERFACE

HCI for physically challenged impaired people with respect to movement need to satisfy certain conditions such as HCI should not be in connection, avoid dedicated apparatus,
it should offer better performance, and it should get processed on customer computer. 
The main reasons for these conditions are not because the research could gather lesser capital but because the end user might not be able to afford highly expensive commodities and 
hence a system working on one of the most common of infrastructure is of great use to the user.
3.3	Hardware Requirements
CPU	: Intel 2.1 GHZ

Memory	: 4GB

Disk	: 100GB

Display	: 15 inch color


Camera Installation: The software needs to detect the blinking of eyes with the assistance of camera. So, the computer should be installed with the camera. 
Desktop computer doesnâ€™t have camera, so an extra camera needs to be installed and linked to the software. The laptop is equipped with the camera, so it will be linked.


3.4	Software (Tools &Technologies) Requirements

Coding	: Python
Platform	: python 3.7 or 3.8 Tool	: Spyder
OS	: Windows 7


Open CV: It is a library of programming functions mainly realtime computer vision. 
It was originally developed by Intel and it was later supported by Willow Garage and is now maintained by IITSSEZ. 
OpenCV is written in C++ and is primarily interface is in C++. There are bindings in python, java and MATLAB/Octave.


Installation and Usage: run pip install OpenCVpython Import the packages for 3 3OpenCV: Open Python IDLE and type following codes in Python terminal.
>>>import cv2

>>>print(cv.version)

Python dlib: It is developed by Davis King, the dlib C++ library is a cross-platform package for threading networking, numerical operations.
placing a strong emphasis on extremely high- quality and portable code. 
From a computer vision perspective, dlib has reveal state-of- the-art implementations, including:
Facial landmark detection, Correlation tracking, Deep metric learning.
